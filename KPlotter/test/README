In order to run this package you need to do several things:

  First:  set up your CMSSW environment by executing the following command:
    eval `scramv1 runtime -csh` //for a tcsh or csh shell environment
    eval `scramv1 runtime -sh` //for a zsh or bash shell environment
  Second you will need to navigate to the KPlotter/test directory
    Open the kplotter.cfg file:
      Modify the fileNames parameter to point to the file you want to run on
      Modify the value of trigType if you desire
  Finally you can execute the command

cmsRun kplotter.cfg

which will run the job and create the root file that contains the histograms.  To view them type root -l <filename>
  Alternatively, you can run

./runKPlotter.sh <run number>


N.B - Do not use run number of 0 as an input as this will cause the job to seg fault, also, not specifying a run number will default to 0.
